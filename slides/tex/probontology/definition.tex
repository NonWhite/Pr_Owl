\subsection{Probabilistic Ontology}

\begin{frame}
	An ontology is an explicit, formal knowledge representation that express knowledge about a domain of application. This includes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Types of entities that exist in the domain
		\item Properties of those entities
		\item Relationships among entities
		\item Processes and events that happen with those entities
	\end{itemize}
