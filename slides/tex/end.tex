\subsection{Conclusions and Future Work}
	\begin{frame}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The proposed heuristics lead to better solutions on average, and increase the convergence of the search with only a small overhead
			\item Larger diferences for datasets with more variables are expected
			\item Our proposed techniques could return directed acyclic graphs instead of node orderings to be used for Structure- and Equivalence-based search approaches
			\item Employ the proposed heuristics in branch-and-bound solvers for finding optimal solutions
		\end{itemize}
